Sometimes you just need a codename.
This is a very simple codename generator that will take an input file and return two words that are maybe suitable for a codename.

You will need to have the Natural Language Toolkit installed - pip3 install nltk
You will need to install some additional nltk modules - run the code and install what it tells you.

I am currently using a speech as the text - if you want to use something else, replace the textFile with a text source of your choosing. Experiment!
